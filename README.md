# AppTano

## Inspiration 
I enjoy the content Anthony Fantano aka The Needle Drop aka Melon makes and decided
to use his data as part of a project

## What it does
This is an app I created in a hacking session to learn React Native. It pulls review around 100 review scores from:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GbGyWVtePH8RZCZd7N3RPDh8m-K6hgO6AyKsAHZpbeQ/edit#gid=0
an formats them into the app.

## How I built it
I built it using React and React Native and serpating each piece of the UI into a different components.

## Challenges I ran into
I've never use any React style framework or JSX before this, so this was a good introduction to these new useful frameworks.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
The app preforms nicely and looks pretty good.

## What I learned
The fundementals of React Native
## What's next for AppTano
Maybe adding images, links to the videos, expandable cards, search, more stats.
## Here's what it looks like
